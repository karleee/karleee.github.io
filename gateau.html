			<p class="GateauIntroduction-text">Gateau is a mobile app for royal couples who are in the midst of planning
				their special day and looking for a seamless
				way to select the perfect wedding cake. This was created as a personal project, with the objective being to strengthen
				my skills as a designer and to have some
				fun!</p>

		<p class="GateauBackground-header">BACKGROUND</p>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text">As part of a creative exercise, I wanted to create something unique that would
			exist in a fictional (or perhaps real) world where ghosts roamed about. I was the sole designer and I was
			responsible for the product
			design and UX/UI experience for the app. Whilst the project was short, some key achievements are listed below:</p>
		<ul class="list">
			<li class="text"><span class="text-bold">Applied design sprints to inform my process.</span> I was able to
				effectively apply the design sprints process to identify the problem, ideate on the solution, prototype and
				implement the final product.</li>
			<li class="text"><span class="text-bold">Executed end to end.</span> Within a few weeks, I was able to create an
				extremely polished prototype of the main functions on the app, which demonstrates my ability to execute and ship
				quickly.</li>
			<li class="text"><span class="text-bold">Designed with restraint.</span> As a former front-end software engineer,
				I was able to identify what would be technically feasible in my design and I also drew a parallel with advanced
				Figma techniques like variables and conditionals to improve my workflow.</li>

		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="BooVoyage-Section Section-color">
		<p class="GateauBackground-header">UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM</p>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text">I conducted a brainstorming workshop with the users of similar applications in
			the real-world and it was revealed that:</p>
		<ul class="list">
			<li class="GateauIntroduction-text">Individuals preferred to filter their search results by simpler, more generic
				terms than extremely granular ones</li>
			<li class="GateauIntroduction-text">Individuals preferred to have the option of completing the checkout process as
				a guest user rather than having to log in or register for an account</li>
			<li class="GateauIntroduction-text">Individuals preferred to have less text heavy pages and more visual aids (i.e.
				photos, icons, etc.)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="BooVoyage-Section">
		<p class="GateauBackground-header">PRODUCT VISION & STATEMENT</p>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text">From these findings, I decided as a product to identify key business goals:</p>
		<ul class="list">
			<li class="GateauIntroduction-text">I want users to quickly and easily filter through their search results</li>
			<li class="GateauIntroduction-text">I want users to have the freedom to use my platform, whether or not they have
				an existing account</li>
			<li class="GateauIntroduction-text">I want users to be informed while having an enjoyable experience when
				scrolling through my application</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text">As a starting point, I did some market research on competitors to investigate
			current offerings in the market
			and take inspiration from particular features that I liked about each app.</p>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text">I then conducted a couple of 15 minute sketching sessions to draw out my vision
			of the solution.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="BooVoyage-Section Section-color">
		<p class="GateauBackground-header">DEFINING THE MVP</p>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text">Based on the sketching sessions, it was revealed that there were commonalties in
			the product vision. I identified the
			following key user stories:</p>
		<ul class="list">
			<li class="GateauIntroduction-text"><span class="text-bold">Short & Sweet.</span> Users can quickly filter through
				their search results with options that strike a balance between being broad enough to cover the overall search
				term and granular enough to help narrow down what the user is looking for exactly</li>
			<li class="GateauIntroduction-text"><span class="text-bold">Picture Book.</span> Users can easily find the most
				pertinent information about a listing through clear text and imagery</li>
			<li class="GateauIntroduction-text"><span class="text-bold">Happy Trails.</span> Users can roam the supernatural
				universe with listings available in a variety of locations and categories</li>
		</ul>

			<div class="Sketch Sketch-flow"></div>
			<div class="Sketch Sketch-wireframes"></div>
		</div>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text">In order to begin on the Figma prototype, I mocked up the main screens for the
			MVP based off the sketches
			that I created and came up with the following:</p>
		<ul class="list">
			<li class="GateauIntroduction-text">Home screen</li>
			<li class="GateauIntroduction-text">Filtering menu</li>
			<li class="GateauIntroduction-text">Search results screen</li>
			<li class="GateauIntroduction-text">Home rental screen</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="BooVoyage-Section">
		<p class="GateauBackground-header">DESIGN</p>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text">I created some mockups of the basic user journey before going over it with the
			desired
			styling. I opted for a simple color scheme, based on the traditional Halloween colors, and a straightforward UI. I
			then created a
			clickable prototype in Figma.</p>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text text-bold">Home screen</p>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text">This screen was created to give users a good entry point into the application,
			where they could easily access all the main features (i.e. filtering, searching by keyword or by cateogry, & view
			a listing)</p>
		<div class="Screen Screen-home"></div>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text text-bold">Filtering menu</p>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text">This menu was added to give users the ability to select and apply filtering
			options of their choice for a desired result</p>
		<div class="Screen Screen-filter"></div>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text text-bold">Search results screen</p>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text">This search index page was included to display all relevant listings to the user
			per their previously seleted filters or keywords</p>
		<div class="Screen Screen-searchResults"></div>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text text-bold">Home rental screen</p>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text">This detailed listing depicts more information about available rental homes to
			users so that they can make a more informed decision</p>
		<div class="Screen Screen-rental"></div>
	</div>
	<div class="BooVoyage-Section Section-color">
		<p class="GateauBackground-header">DEVELOPMENT</p>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text">I used InkScape to create detailed slides with the project brief, mood boards,
			diagrams, and wireframes. For the polished designs and the working interactive prototype, I used Figma to bring
			everything to life.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="BooVoyage-Section">
		<p class="GateauBackground-header">RESULTS & TAKEAWAYS</p>
		<p class="GateauIntroduction-text">I was able to successfully implement 75% of the designs in Figma, as well as a
			working prototype that gives users a more detailed glimpse into what the application would feel like. In the
			future, I hope to implement the remaining 25% of the screens (i.e. account page, favorites page, etc.) and to make
			the filtering fully functional in both the Figma designs and prototype.</p>
