      <p class="Overview-Body">BooVoyage is a mobile app for ghosts who are planning their next spooky vacation and are in need of a house to haunt for the duration of their stay. This was created as a personal project, with the objective being to
        strengthen
        my skills as a designer and to have some
        fun!</p>

    <p class="Section-Header">BACKGROUND</p>
    <p class="Section-Body">As part of a creative exercise, I wanted to create something unique that would exist in a fictional (or perhaps real) world where ghosts roamed about. I was the sole designer and I was responsible for the product
    design and UX/UI experience for the app. Whilst the project was short, some key achievements are listed below:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li class="Section-Body"><span class="Bold">Applied design sprints to inform my process.</span> I was able to effectively apply the design sprints process to identify the problem, ideate on the solution, prototype and implement the final product.</li>
      <li class="Section-Body"><span class="Bold">Executed end to end.</span> Within a few weeks, I was able to create an extremely polished prototype of the main functions on the app, which demonstrates my ability to execute and ship quickly.</li>
      <li class="Section-Body"><span class="Bold">Designed with restraint.</span> As a former front-end software engineer, I was able to identify what would be technically feasible in my design and I also drew a parallel with advanced Figma techniques like variables and conditionals to improve my workflow.</li>

    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="Section Section-Color">
    <p class="Section-Header">UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM</p>
    <p class="Section-Body">I conducted a brainstorming workshop with the users of similar applications in the real-world and it was revealed that:</p>
    <ul class="List">
      <li class="Section-Body">Individuals preferred to filter their search results by simpler, more generic terms than extremely granular ones</li>
      <li class="Section-Body">Individuals preferred to have the option of completing the checkout process as a guest user rather than having to log in or register for an account</li>
      <li class="Section-Body">Individuals preferred to have less text heavy pages and more visual aids (i.e. photos, icons, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="Section">
    <p class="Section-Header">PRODUCT VISION & STATEMENT</p>
    <p class="Section-Body">From these findings, I decided as a product to identify key business goals:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li class="Section-Body">I want users to quickly and easily filter through their search results</li>
      <li class="Section-Body">I want users to have the freedom to use my platform, whether or not they have an existing account</li>
      <li class="Section-Body">I want users to be informed while having an enjoyable experience when scrolling through my application</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Section-Body">As a starting point, I did some market research on competitors to investigate current offerings in the market
    and take inspiration from particular features that I liked about each app.</p>
    <p class="Section-Body">I then conducted a couple of 15 minute sketching sessions to draw out my vision of the solution.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="Section Section-Color">
    <p class="Section-Header">DEFINING THE MVP</p>
    <p class="Section-Body">Based on the sketching sessions, it was revealed that there were commonalties in the product vision. I identified the
    following key user stories:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li class="Section-Body"><span class="Bold">Short & Sweet.</span> Users can quickly filter through their search results with options that strike a balance between being broad enough to cover the overall search term and granular enough to help narrow down what the user is looking for exactly</li>
      <li class="Section-Body"><span class="Bold">Picture Book.</span> Users can easily find the most pertinent information about a listing through clear text and imagery</li>
      <li class="Section-Body"><span class="Bold">Happy Trails.</span> Users can roam the supernatural universe with listings available in a variety of locations and categories</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="Sketches">
      <div class="Sketch Sketch-ProjectBrief"></div>
      <div class="Sketch Sketch-Flow"></div>
      <div class="Sketch Sketch-Wireframes"></div>
    </div>
    <p class="Section-Body">In order to begin on the Figma prototype, I mocked up the main screens for the MVP based off the sketches
    that I created and came up with the following:</p>
    <ul class="List">
      <li class="Section-Body">Home screen</li>
      <li class="Section-Body">Filtering menu</li>
      <li class="Section-Body">Search results screen</li>
      <li class="Section-Body">Home rental screen</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="Section">
    <p class="Section-Header">DESIGN</p>
    <p class="Section-Body">I created some mockups of the basic user journey before going over it with the desired
    styling. I opted for a simple color scheme, based on the traditional Halloween colors, and a straightforward UI. I then created a
    clickable prototype in Figma.</p>
    <p class="Section-Body Bold">Home screen</p>
    <p class="Section-Body">This screen was created to give users a good entry point into the application, where they could easily access all the main features (i.e. filtering, searching by keyword or by cateogry, & view a listing)</p>
    <div class="Screen Screen-Home"></div>
    <p class="Section-Body Bold">Filtering menu</p>
    <p class="Section-Body">This menu was added to give users the ability to select and apply filtering options of their choice for a desired result</p>
    <div class="Screen Screen-Filter"></div>
    <p class="Section-Body Bold">Search results screen</p>
    <p class="Section-Body">This search index page was included to display all relevant listings to the user per their previously seleted filters or keywords</p>
    <div class="Screen Screen-SearchResults"></div>
    <p class="Section-Body Bold">Home rental screen</p>
    <p class="Section-Body">This detailed listing depicts more information about available rental homes to users so that they can make a more informed decision</p>
    <div class="Screen Screen-Rental"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="Section Section-Color">
    <p class="Section-Header">DEVELOPMENT</p>
    <p class="Section-Body">I used InkScape to create detailed slides with the project brief, mood boards, diagrams, and wireframes. For the polished designs and the working interactive prototype, I used Figma to bring everything to life.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="Section">
    <p class="Section-Header">RESULTS & TAKEAWAYS</p>
    <p class="Section-Body">I was able to successfully implement 75% of the designs in Figma, as well as a working prototype that gives users a more detailed glimpse into what the application would feel like. In the future, I hope to implement the remaining 25% of the screens (i.e. account page, favorites page, etc.) and to make the filtering fully functional in both the Figma designs and prototype.</p>
